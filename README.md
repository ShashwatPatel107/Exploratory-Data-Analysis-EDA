# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

> A data-driven analytical project focusing on discovering patterns, spotting anomalies, and testing hypotheses using visualization and statistical summaries.

## 🌟 Goal

To perform in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset to uncover meaningful insights and communicate findings visually and effectively.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains the complete process of conducting EDA using Python. The analysis is designed to understand the structure and distribution of data, detect outliers, check correlations, and prepare the dataset for downstream tasks like modeling or reporting.

It serves as a practical demonstration of data storytelling and analytical thinking using tools widely used in the data industry.

* 🔢 Statistical summaries and aggregations
* 🌐 Handling missing data and outliers
* 🔄 Feature correlation and distribution plots
* 🌎 Beautifully structured visualizations using Seaborn/Matplotlib
* 🎨 Notebook-based storytelling (ideal for presentations)

## 🚧 Process

1. Load dataset and perform basic sanity checks
2. Clean and preprocess data (handling missing values, duplicates)
3. Generate descriptive statistics
4. Visualize distributions and relationships
5. Identify outliers and trends
6. Summarize findings and recommendations

---

## 📅 Future Enhancements

* Integrate automated profiling tools like Pandas-Profiling or Sweetviz
* Add interactive dashboards using Plotly or Streamlit
* Build machine learning pipelines on top of cleaned data
* Convert notebook into a presentable PDF or web report
