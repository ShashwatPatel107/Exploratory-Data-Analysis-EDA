## GOAL
To extract meaningful insights and information from data through visual representations. By visualizing data, patterns, relationships, and trends become easier to see and understand. This can lead to more informed decision-making, improved communication, and increased understanding of the data.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
1. Python
2. opendataset
3. Pandas
4. NumPy
5. Matplotlib
6. Seaborn
7. Plotly




## DATASET

In this project I have selected Playstore's App dataset from [Kaggle DATASET](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauthamp10/google-playstore-apps).

## Process
1. DATA COLLECTION
  * Download dataset fron Internet  using 'opendata'

2. EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS
  * Read Dataset with Pandas
  * Create Dataframe
  * Clean raw data with Pandas

3. Data Visualization
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * Plotly.express


## CONCLUSION
1. Analysis revealed the most popular categories of apps, the average ratings and size of apps, and the distribution of installs by price.

2. Also explored the relationship between app ratings and installs, and found that higher rated apps tend to have more installs. 

These findings can be useful for app developers and marketers as they plan their app strategy, as well as for users who want to find high-quality apps.
